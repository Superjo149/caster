## The Idea

**One API, any Client**

```js
import server from '@cast/server';
import ChromeCast from '@cast/client-chromecast';
import AirPlay from '@cast/client-airplay';
import Dlna from '@cast/client-dlna';

await server({
  subtitles: path.join(srtPath),
  content: path.join(videoPath),
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 1234,
  clients: [
    ChromeCast,
    AirPlay,
    Dlna({
      volume: 90,
      ...customOptions
    })
  ]
});
```
